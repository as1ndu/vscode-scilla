# Scilla for VSCode

Scilla, short for Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language, is an intermediate-level smart contract language being developed for [Zilliqa](https://zilliqa.com/). Scilla has been designed as a principled language with smart contract safety in mind.
‍
Scilla imposes a structure on smart contracts that will make applications less vulnerable to attacks by eliminating certain known vulnerabilities directly at the language-level. Furthermore, the principled structure of Scilla will make applications inherently more secure and amenable to formal verification.
‍
The language is being developed hand-in-hand with formalization of its semantics and its embedding into the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/) — a state-of-the art tool for mechanized proofs about properties of programs.
